Title:
Flock Freight Offer Acceptance

Abstract:
Flock Freight is a company that engages with a variety of carriers and shipments, operating as
a marketplace for freight carriers to submit bids on shipping orders that need to be fulfilled,
a function commonly referred to as a "freight broker." Other companies remunerate Flock
Freight to transport their shipments, which are subsequently outsourced to freight carriers.
The company often encounters complications related to the bid acceptance procedure. Some
shipment orders receive multiple offers, and minimizing the cost of orders is crucial to the
enterprise since it maximizes profits.
The objective of this project is to present a machine learning technique that will establish
the optimal stopping point for the acceptance and reneging of delivery offers by carriers for
Flock Freightâ€™s orders.
